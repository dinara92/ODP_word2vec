dict.csv - mapping (key,value) - (word, vector) from this model: /trained_models_pages/train_pages_10context/kaggleODP_pages_200features_0minwords_10context
other files are vectors generated from running ODP_AverageVectors.py

get2ModelsAvgFeatureVecs_file - vectors of sentences from trainPages file, but average of local odp model and global google news model

get2ModelsAvgFeatureVecs_file_test - same as above, but for testPages

/***********************************************/
above gave bad result, maybe because #sent_vec = np.add(sent_vec, model1[w], model2[w])
so, change that and now have
get2ModelsAvgFeatureVecs_train_2
get2ModelsAvgFeatureVecs_test_2 files
